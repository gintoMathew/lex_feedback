# Feedback component for Opportunity

A custom component that lets you capture a feedback for a specific Opportunity. When the opportunity record is marked as Closed, this component will be visible on the record detail page (you need to add the component to the opportunity detail page and set the visibility condition) and the user needs to enter the corresponding feedback. 
All the feedback questions can be easily configured by the admin. The questions will be stored in the 'Feedback' object. Have more than 5 questions? No worries, just add the custom field (make sure the API naming convention is the same) to the custom object and you are good to go. 

// This is project uses very basic tags and logic, feel free to add your own!

Happy Coding!
